    <h1>Notes from the Urakawa Application group</h1>
    <address>Julien Quint <code>&lt;<a href="mailto:julien@daisy-for-all.org">julien@daisy-for-all.org</a>&gt;</code><br/>
      First draft, 28 November 2005</address>

    <p>Here are some preliminary notes from the Application group of the
    Urakawa project. The main purpose of this document is to discuss what the
    application will look like and what manpower will be available to achieve
    the August 2006 deadline of the first iteration. Quick TOC:
    <a href="#deadlines">Deadlines</a>, <a href="#scope">Scope</a> and
    <a href="#staffing">Staffing</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="deadline">Deadlines</h2>
    <p>One the first items on the todo list of the Application group is to make
    a roadmap with precise milestones. But we can already identify three main
    deadlines:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A detailed project proposal for funding and staffing, which should be
      ready ASAP (probably December?)</li>
      <li>A first deliverable by the end of the fiscal year (<em>i.e.</em> end
      of March 2006?) This would be a mockup of the Application, something like
      a working GUI without the processor.</li>
      <li>The Application itself is due in August 2006.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
    <p>There are three things that we could do with this Application:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A testbed for the Urakawa processor. Not very exciting or useful to
      end-users, but useful for the project and definitely achievable in the
      given timeframe.</li>
      <li>A solid, if limited in scope, Daisy production tool. This is the
      best for end-users but will require very careful planning and
      design.</li>
      <li>An experimental platform for user interface interaction. I am by no
      means an expert in accessibility and graphical user interface, but the
      sorry state of the currently available DAISY production tools is an
      indication that there must exist better ways to make DAISY books. The
      Urakawa processor could then provide a good foundation for experimenting
      with new interfaces and workflows.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Reallistically, we should probably aim for the second target. That being
    said, there can be room for the other two targets.</p>
    <p class="in">With regards to testing, we should get some help later (after
    April?) from the Swiss Library for the Blind for the express purpose of
    testing. Moreover, even if the application has a limited scope, it will
    probably still use many of the capabilities of the processor and still
    provide a good testbed for the processor. It should also focus on new
    features of the <a href="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/z3986-2005.html">Z
      spec</a>.</p>
    <p class="in">With regards to experimentation, the fact that a mockup
    is due before the full application is delivered can be used to try to
    experiment with the final GUI. Making an accessible DAISY production tool
    is especially challenging so there are many possibilities to explore.</p>
    <p class="in">The problem of the exact scope of the Application still
    remains. It is especially difficult to solve without a better idea of how
    many people will actually work on implementing it. A way around this is
    to have elastic goals that can be stretched or shrunk depending on the
    resources available. Here is a short list of possible features for the
    Application, roughly in the order in which they should be implemented:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Importing a DAISY 2.02 book and saving it as a DAISY 3 book. This
      should be made possible by the processor without much work on the
      Application side.</li>
      <li>Adding skippable items to the book.</li>
      <li>Managing resources. This will require audio recording and editing
      capabilities...</li>
      <li>... which can be used to add and modify audio content of the book
      (similar to what <a
        href="http://daisy.org/tools/production.asp#sdar3">Sigtuna DAR 3</a>
      can do.)</li>
      <li>From there, there is a lot of possibilities to discuss. What kind(s)
      of books do we want to target? How to modify the text content without
      having to do a full DTBook markup editor?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Application should be modular and easily extensible, but we must
    have long-term goals in mind when doing the design, even if we know that
    there won't be enough time to reach all of them.</p>
    <p class="in">Hopefully, the Application will prove useful to people
    outside of the
    Urakawa project. Since the application will be free software (the
    management team still has to decide the exact licensing scheme, but we
    can assume that it will allow anyone to access the source code, modify it
    and redistribute it) and that we will have a clear plan for its extension,
    we may benefit in the future from help from the user community.</p>
    
    <h2 id="staffing">Staffing</h2>
    <p>After some initial discussions in Tunis, there are still many unknowns
    about who will join the Application group. Currently I am the only member
    and count for about 0.5 FTE; I hope that Linus can join soon for 0.5 FTE
    as well. It seems that Jun Ishikawa would join to help with management at
    first, with possible coding contributions after April? There is also the
    "testing" team from Switzerland which may join around this time (see
    above.)</p>
    <p class="in">In any case, at
    least one more developer is needed so that the three of us could get
    something like 2 FTE total (which may involve some stretching.) Maybe
    there are some possibilities from Dipendra's camp?</p>
